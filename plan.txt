Plan of Attack: (Comp Sci Majors)

USER INPUT
- ba or bs option
- user will open interface and be asked which of the different jobs interest them
- check all that interest them 
- upload picture of their transcript
- will upload image to Ai that will output exact course names through webscraping (variable courseNames)
- Ai will list all the courses they taken


BACKEND
- get csv list of all courses using course numbers (course #, name, descriptions, credits,)
- look through descriptions of course and using keywords determine the subjects of the course
- create an object intiliazer (name, subjects, descriptions, credits, course #, boolean taken = false) and method that puts each element of the csv 
list through it the object intiliazer and 2darray (maybe arrayList)
- getter methods
- courses they have taken will be turned to TRUE and will not be printed out
- traverse through course list and print out courses that they have not taken
- required courses and elective courseNames
- traverse through courses check if subjects match, if match check if taken. 
- Check if required or elective and split into two lists and print out

FRONTEND
- put everything into intuitive UI
